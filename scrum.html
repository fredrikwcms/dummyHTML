  <h1>Scrum</h1>
  <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
  <p>
    Scrum is a simple framework that is focus on team collaboration and it helps team to build complex products easily. Scrum is not a methodology but it is a science experiment. The product is built in a time serie which is called "sprints". Scrum divides the sprints
    in four stage:
    <ol>
      <li>Sprint planning: Team has a plan for the next sprint</li>
      <li>Daily stand-up: A quickly meeting for team, 15-minute meeting</li>
      <li>Sprint demo: Team tells each other about what they have done in this sprint</li>
      <li>Sprint retrospective: Team reviews what is done and what is haven't done and make it better</li>

    </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>The Scrum Team</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The product owner: who creates the product backlog or user stories (wish list) - what they need in the product.</li>
    <li>The development team: will complete the backlog from the product owner</li>
    <li>The ScrumMaster: helps the development team to understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values - keep the team reach the goal.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>A Scrum framework</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>A product owner creates a product backlog (user story) - create a wish list for developers.</li>
    <li>During the sprint, the team picks up the list from backlog and completes it.</li>
    <li>Team works on the task.</li>
    <li>A daily meeting to see the progress for the work and the ScrumMaster keeps the team focus on the goal.</li>
    <li>At the end of the sprint, the work should be ready and can delivery to a product owner.</li>
    <li>The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective. A sprint review happends when a product owner and the development team will meet and discuss about a backlog for example which items have been done or which items haven't done. As for sprint retrospective, it is an process that team will inspect what needs to be improve.</li>
    <li>The circle repeats for the next sprint</li>
  </ol>
