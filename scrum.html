  <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
  <p>
    Scrum is a simple framwork that is focus on team collaboration and it helps team build complex products easily. Scrum is not a methodology but it is a science experiment. The product is built in a time serie which is called "sprints". Scrum divides sprint
    in four stage:
    <ol>
      <li>Sprint planning: Team has a plan for the next sprint</li>
      <li>Daily stand-up: A quickly meeting for team, 15-minute meeting</li>
      <li>Sprint demo: Team tells each other about what they have done in this sprint</li>
      <li>Sprint retrospective: Team reviews what is done and what is haven't done and make it better</li>

    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Scrum has three rolls.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The product owner</li>
    <li>Development team</li>
    <li>Scrum master</li>
  </ol>
